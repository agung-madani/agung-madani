Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Agung Rashif Madani, and I am an Informatics student with a passion for creating smart systems.

During my studies, I have gained a diverse range of skills in programming languages such as Python, SQL, PHP, C++, Java, and Prolog, as well as in data management tools like Excel and Google Sheets.
Currently, I am particularly focused on Machine Learning, and I am always seeking opportunities to improve my skills and learn about new technologies.
