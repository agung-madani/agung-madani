Hello and welcome to my GitHub profile! My name is Agung Rashif Madani and I am an Informatics student with a passion for smart systems.

Throughout my studies, I have gained skills in various programming languages such as Python and SQL, as well as data management tools like Excel and Google Sheets. I am always looking to improve my skills and learn new technologies, and I am excited to be a part of the GitHub community to collaborate with other developers and contribute to open source projects.

I am always looking for new opportunities to apply my skills and make a positive impact. Thank you for visiting my profile and I hope to connect with you soon!
